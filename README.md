## Experience
### Xenvis Solutions
**Project - Building an augmented reality measurement application**  
[Link](https://www.xenvis.com/measurements-using-augmented-reality/)  
•	Led the development efforts to create an interactive augmented reality point-to-point measurement application. Utilized computer vision packages notably improving the efficiency of product quality inspections compared to manual methods.  
•	Conducted research to optimize image preprocessing for the development of a proprietary 3D model reconstruction software. Achieved ~20% improvement in processing time.
