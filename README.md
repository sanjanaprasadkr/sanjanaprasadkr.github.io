## Publications
**Supervised Learning Techniques for Detection of Underwater Acoustic Sources**
[View Publication](assets/Supervised_Learning_Techniques_for_Detection_of_Underwater_Acoustic_Sources.pdf)
- Python: TensorFlow, scikit-learn, numpy, matplotlib
- Machine Learning: support vector machine (SVM), logistic regression, naive Bayes, decision tree, random forest
- Performance Metrics: accuracy, probability of detection
- Statistical Concepts: classification, hypothesis testing, Monte Carlo simulation, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)
- Noise Model: Generalised Gaussian Distribution
- Datasets: synthetic (generated) and real-world dataset
-  A good match between the theoretical and simulated probability of detection values exhibited the accuracy of the supervised learning algorithms. SVM consistently outperformed all other algorithms in detecting an underwater acoustic source.

- Deep Learning: convolutional neural networks (CNN), plain deep neural network, recurrent neural network, long short term memory (LSTM), gated recurrent unit
- Performance Metrics: accuracy, probability of detection, probability of false alarm
- Datasets: synthetic (generated) dataset and real-world datasets
- SVM outperformed all other algorithms in detecting an underwater acoustic source, particularly in low signal-to-noise ratio scenarios.
