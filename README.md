## About
I am a Data Science graduate student at Boston University. I completed my Bachelor’s degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering at PES University.  

This summer, I interned at Dassault Systemes as a Data Science Intern, where I worked on improving data pipelines for **[BIOVIA's Pipeline Pilot](https://www.3ds.com/products/biovia/pipeline-pilot)**.

## Industry Experience

### [Dassault Systemes](https://www.3ds.com)
**Data Science Intern**

At Dassault Systèmes, I concentrated on developing deep learning components to enhance scientific data pipelines, particularly in pharmaceutical drug development. My efforts focused on improving the interpretability of model predictions, complemented by the creation of comprehensive protocols and output visualizations to support ongoing research and development.

A significant highlight was my involvement in **[Pipeline Pilot's Imaging Collection](https://www.3ds.com/products/biovia/pipeline-pilot/imaging-collection)**, where I helped integrate advanced imaging capabilities into BIOVIA’s Pipeline Pilot. This work expanded the platform’s functionality for scientific applications, facilitating the manipulation and analysis of scientific imaging data. 

I also acquired valuable experience in product management working under BIOVIA’s product manager, focusing on Agile methodologies, JIRA, user story maps, and HorseShoes for pipelines, maintaining alignment between product development and user needs. 


### [Xenvis Solutions](https://www.xenvis.com)
**Machine Learning Intern**  

As part of the Technology & Research team, my primary focus was developing XenCapture, an AI-driven software for photorealistic 2D to 3D model reconstruction, for AR/ VR applications. This has since been rolled out as a full-scale product **[(product link)](https://xencapture.com)**. I contributed to the development of dataset curation, pre-processing pipelines, and research focused on using machine learning to interpolate missing data points that were not captured during the scanning process. 

One of the standout projects I led was the development of an AR measurement app built using Unity. This app allowed users to make precise point-to-point measurements of physical objects using their phone's camera, leveraging computer vision techniques. I authored a blog post detailing various use cases for customers **[(blog link)](https://www.xenvis.com/measurements-using-augmented-reality/)**.
